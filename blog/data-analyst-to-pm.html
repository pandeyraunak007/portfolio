    <article class="blog-content">
        <p>In 2016, I was a Risk Analyst at Amazon, writing SQL queries and building dashboards. By 2019, I was a Product Manager at S&P Global. Today, I lead AI product strategy at Quest Software.</p>

        <p>The transition from data analyst to PM isn't obvious, but it's increasingly common — and for good reason. Data analysts have skills that many traditional PMs lack: comfort with ambiguity, fluency with metrics, and the ability to find truth in messy datasets.</p>

        <p>Here's the honest roadmap I wish someone had given me.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why Data Analysts Make Great PMs</h2>

        <p>Before the "how," let's address the "why." Data analysts have unfair advantages in product management:</p>

        <h3>1. You Already Speak the Language of Evidence</h3>

        <p>Most PMs struggle to be data-informed. They know they should use data, but they don't have the instincts for it. You do. You know when a metric is misleading. You know how to segment. You know that correlation isn't causation.</p>

        <p>This is a superpower. Use it.</p>

        <h3>2. You Understand How Products Actually Work</h3>

        <p>You've seen the data. You know which features get used and which collect dust. You've probably thought "why did they build it this way?" more than once.</p>

        <p>That frustrated curiosity? That's product sense waiting to be channeled.</p>

        <h3>3. You're Comfortable With Uncertainty</h3>

        <p>Data analysis is fundamentally about finding signal in noise. Product management is the same — you're constantly making decisions with incomplete information.</p>

        <p>Analysts who've learned to make recommendations despite uncertainty are already practicing a core PM skill.</p>

        <h3>4. You Have Credibility With Engineering</h3>

        <p>Engineers respect people who can engage with technical details. Your SQL skills, your understanding of data pipelines, your familiarity with system architecture — these build trust that many PMs spend years earning.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Gaps You'll Need to Close</h2>

        <p>Let's be honest about what data analysts typically lack:</p>

        <h3>Gap 1: Customer Empathy</h3>

        <p>Analysts often see users as data points. Rows in a table. Behavioral patterns to be modeled.</p>

        <p>PMs need to see users as humans with frustrations, workarounds, and unspoken needs. This requires a different kind of attention.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>How to close it</h4>
            <p>Start talking to users directly. Not surveys. Not data. Actual conversations. Ask open-ended questions. Listen for emotions, not just facts.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Gap 2: Strategic Thinking</h3>

        <p>Analysts are trained to answer questions. PMs need to decide which questions are worth answering.</p>

        <p>This shift — from "given these constraints, what's the answer?" to "given these possibilities, what should we prioritize?" — is harder than it sounds.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>How to close it</h4>
            <p>Practice making recommendations, not just presenting findings. End every analysis with "therefore, we should..." and defend that position.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Gap 3: Communication and Influence</h3>

        <p>Data work is often solo. You analyze, you present, you move on.</p>

        <p>PM work is fundamentally collaborative. You need to align stakeholders who have different incentives, communicate across technical and non-technical audiences, and influence people who don't report to you.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>How to close it</h4>
            <p>Volunteer to present your team's work. Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences. Learn to tell stories with data, not just report numbers.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Gap 4: Ownership Mentality</h3>

        <p>Analysts typically own a deliverable — a report, a dashboard, an analysis.</p>

        <p>PMs own an outcome. The difference is profound. When you own an outcome, you can't blame the data, the engineering team, or the requirements. You find a way to make it work.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>How to close it</h4>
            <p>Take ownership of something small but end-to-end. A feature, a process, a problem. See it through from conception to launch to measurement.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Practical Playbook</h2>

        <p>Here's what actually worked for me:</p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Build PM Skills in Your Current Role (3-6 months)</h3>

        <p>You don't need a PM title to do PM work. Start now:</p>

        <h4>1. Get closer to customers</h4>

        <p>Ask to join customer calls. Volunteer to analyze support tickets. Read every piece of customer feedback you can find. Build a reputation as someone who understands users.</p>

        <h4>2. Start making recommendations</h4>

        <p>Don't just deliver analysis — deliver analysis + recommendation. "Based on this data, I recommend we prioritize X because Y."</p>

        <p>Most analysts stop at the data. You'll stand out by going further.</p>

        <h4>3. Understand the roadmap</h4>

        <p>Get access to your product's roadmap. Understand why features were prioritized. Ask PMs about their decision-making process. Learn the vocabulary and frameworks they use.</p>

        <h4>4. Ship something small</h4>

        <p>Find a small improvement — a dashboard, a workflow fix, a minor feature — and own it end-to-end. Write the requirements. Work with engineering. See it through to launch. Measure the impact.</p>

        <p>This is PM work, even without the title.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Build Your PM Toolkit (3-6 months)</h3>

        <p>While doing Phase 1, start learning PM fundamentals:</p>

        <h4>Core Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Product strategy and vision</li>
            <li>Prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Impact/Effort)</li>
            <li>User research methods</li>
            <li>Agile/Scrum mechanics</li>
            <li>Go-to-market basics</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Resources That Actually Helped Me</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>"Inspired" by Marty Cagan — the PM bible</li>
            <li>"Continuous Discovery Habits" by Teresa Torres — modern user research</li>
            <li>Lenny's Newsletter — practical, current advice</li>
            <li>Reforge programs — if you can get your company to pay</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Don't overdo it</strong>. You can read about PM forever. At some point, you need to stop studying and start doing.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Make the Move (1-6 months)</h3>

        <p>Two paths:</p>

        <h4>Internal transfer (easier, lower risk)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to your manager about your interest</li>
            <li>Identify a team that needs PM help</li>
            <li>Propose a trial period or rotation</li>
            <li>Use your internal reputation and relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>External move (broader options, higher risk)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on companies where your domain expertise is valuable</li>
            <li>Emphasize your data skills as a differentiator</li>
            <li>Be prepared for a title or salary step-back initially</li>
            <li>Target PM roles at data-heavy companies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I took the internal path at S&P Global. I'd built credibility as someone who understood the product deeply and could work with engineering. When a PM role opened, I was a natural fit.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Interview: What to Expect</h2>

        <p>PM interviews for data analysts typically focus on:</p>

        <h3>1. Product Sense Questions</h3>
        <p>"How would you improve [product]?"<br>"Design a feature for [user problem]."</p>

        <p><strong>Your advantage:</strong> Use data to inform your answer. "I'd want to analyze user behavior to identify the biggest drop-off points before proposing solutions."</p>

        <h3>2. Analytical Questions</h3>
        <p>"How would you measure success for this feature?"<br>"Walk me through how you'd prioritize these features."</p>

        <p><strong>Your advantage:</strong> This is your home turf. Show depth that other candidates can't match.</p>

        <h3>3. Execution Questions</h3>
        <p>"Tell me about a time you shipped something."<br>"How do you handle disagreements with engineering?"</p>

        <p><strong>Your advantage:</strong> Talk about your experience working with cross-functional teams, even if you weren't the formal "owner."</p>

        <h3>4. Leadership Questions</h3>
        <p>"How do you influence without authority?"<br>"How do you handle ambiguity?"</p>

        <p><strong>Your advantage:</strong> Frame your analytical work as exercises in influence — you had to get stakeholders to act on your recommendations.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Common Mistakes (I Made Some of These)</h2>

        <h3>Mistake 1: Over-indexing on Data</h3>

        <p>Your data skills are a strength. But some new analyst-turned-PMs lean on data as a crutch, avoiding the harder work of customer empathy and strategic decision-making.</p>

        <p>Data informs decisions. It doesn't make them for you.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 2: Waiting for Permission</h3>

        <p>I waited too long to start doing PM work. I thought I needed the title first. Wrong.</p>

        <p>Start doing PM work now. The title follows the work.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 3: Undervaluing Your Background</h3>

        <p>Some analysts feel they need to hide their analytical past to be taken seriously as PMs. Wrong.</p>

        <p>Your background is an asset. The best PMs I know are deeply comfortable with data. Lean into it.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 4: Expecting Immediate Credibility</h3>

        <p>PMs earn trust over time by shipping good products and making good decisions. Your analytical background gets you in the door. You still have to prove yourself.</p>

        <p>Be patient. Be humble. Keep learning.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Is This Transition Right for You?</h2>

        <p>Honest questions to ask yourself:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do you enjoy ambiguity?</strong> PM work rarely has clear right answers. If you need certainty, you'll be frustrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Do you like talking to people?</strong> If your ideal day is headphones on, solo analysis, PM will drain you.</li>
            <li><strong>Can you handle accountability without control?</strong> PMs own outcomes but don't control the resources. This is stressful.</li>
            <li><strong>Are you okay with slow feedback loops?</strong> Analysis gives you answers in hours or days. Products take months or years to prove out.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you answered "yes" to most of these, the transition is worth pursuing.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Real Talk</h2>

        <p>The transition from analyst to PM changed my career trajectory in ways I couldn't have predicted. I've shipped products used by Fortune 500 companies. I've led AI initiatives from concept to production. I've grown revenue by millions of dollars.</p>

        <p>None of that would have happened if I'd stayed in the analytical track.</p>

        <p>But here's the thing: being an analyst made me a better PM. The SQL skills, the statistical intuition, the comfort with data — these aren't things I left behind. They're my competitive advantage.</p>

        <p>You don't become a PM despite your analytical background. You become a PM <em>because of it</em>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data analysts have PM superpowers</strong> — don't undervalue your analytical background</li>
            <li><strong>Close the gaps early</strong> — customer empathy, strategic thinking, communication</li>
            <li><strong>Start doing PM work before you have the title</strong> — ship something small end-to-end</li>
            <li><strong>Internal transfers are easier</strong> — leverage your existing reputation</li>
            <li><strong>Your data skills are an asset, not baggage</strong> — the best PMs are data-fluent</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The path from analyst to PM isn't always straight, but it's increasingly common. The skills that made you a good analyst — curiosity, rigor, comfort with ambiguity — are the same skills that will make you a great PM.</p>

        <p>Start today. Your future self will thank you.</p>
